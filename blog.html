            <time datetime="01-29-2019">JANUARY 31, 2019</time>
            <p>Good morning. I've been thinking about setting this blog up for several...years?...now, but recently a few different things have aligned to make it finally happen.</p>
            
            <figure class="size-4"><img src="images/crissy-field.jpg"></figure>
            <figcaption><p>A new era dawns with the starting of this blog.</p></figcaption> 

            <p>The first is: I really didn't want to use any pre-existing blogging platform, I want my blog to be special. Silly? Yes, kind of. But the whole point of carolineglazer.com was to practice various web design/creation tools. The homepage was a lesson in <code>a:hover</code> and the <code>display</code> property. The inital reason I purchased the domain name was to disply the d3 visualization used for <a href="http://carolineglazer.com/peggy-online/index.html">the "Pretty Peggy" Melodic Contour Charts</a>. To slap on a generic Blogger or Squarespace blog felt like it would spoil the <em>purity</em> (I'm so sorry) of only HTML + CSS.</p>

            <p>Creating a blog from scratch is not that hard, it turns out, especially if you don't think long term about what happens when you have, e.g. more than two posts. It doesn't matter, we're still on post #1! I followed <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-design-and-develop-a-beautiful-blog-from-scratch-a0cd1af46845" target="_blank">this guide</a> to set up this "blog," and I learned some pretty cool things about CSS in the process.</p> 

            <p>The shape of this blog post within this webpage is achieved via the CSS property <code>grid-column-display</code> which feels <em>amazingly</em> powerful compared to any other HTML layout tools I've used in the past. Shocking that my few half-hearted attempts to throw pages onto this site haven't resulted in a thorough working knowledge of CSS. <code>grid-column-display</code> is super flexible and does things like let you name the <code>[start]</code> and <code>[end]</code> points of an article anything you want and define them within the columns of the page layout. It also lets you define object widths as "spanning from the start of column 2 to the end of column 7" which feels so intuitive and lets me quickly and easily produce a cascade of images within the confines of the article tag.</p>

            <figure class="size-3"><img src="images/log.jpg"></figure>
            <figure class="size-2"><img src="images/log.jpg"></figure>
            <figure class="size-1"><img src="images/log.jpg"></figure>
            <figcaption><p>Log within a blog, in three widths.</p></figcaption>

            <p>The last cool thing I've done with this blog is use <strong>media queries</strong> (the <code>@media</code> tag in blog-style.css) to adjust article column widths depending on screen width. That's cool. And if you shrink this window down to less an inch wide, everything will turn fuchsia â€“ that's <em>useful</em>.</p>

            <p>The second reason I've waited so long to start this blog is the lack of anything to write about, which brings us to the chance to test out my <code>h3</code> style:</p>

            <h3>WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS BLOG IN THE FUTURE:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data visualizations:</strong> Always an interesting topic to me, and I am starting a Coursera course on them, so I'll need a place to post the results and motivation to complete assignments well.</li>
                <li><strong>Race reports, maybe?:</strong> I'm new to trail and ultra running, and I'm really excited about it. I'm looking for ways to grow a writing portfolio, especially of pieces about outdoor adventuring. So race reports, cool long run reports, general thoughts on training for ultras: all fair game.</li>
                <li><strong>Other stuff:</strong> It's my blog, I can write anything I want.</li>
                <li><strong>Maybe nothing:</strong> My hope is that I've set this up so that posting is easy enough and not a painful hassle. But we'll see. Maybe I should have used Sqaurespace.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>That's all I can think to say for now. Stay tuned for more, hopefully.</p>
